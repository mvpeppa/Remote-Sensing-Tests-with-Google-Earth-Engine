# Tests-with-Google-Earth-Engine
This tutorial has few jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of google earth engine for visualising global datasets and extracting waterbodies. 

The work here builds upon the very comprehensive tutorials given by Qiusheng Wu (https://www.youtube.com/c/QiushengWu).
