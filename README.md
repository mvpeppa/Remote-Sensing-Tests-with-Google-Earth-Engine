# Tests-with-Google-Earth-Engine
This tutorial has few jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of google earth engine for visualising global datasets and extracting waterbodies. 

The work here builds upon the very comprehensive tutorials given by Qiusheng Wu (https://www.youtube.com/c/QiushengWu). 
Please visit his original instructions on how to install Earth Engine and geemap. 
Those can be found here: https://geemap.org/

To run the test the following dependencies are required:

- To have installed python 3 (check here: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- to have installed Earth Engine and geemap (check here: https://geemap.org/installation/)
- to have installed 
    numpy,
    matplotlib,
    skimage and
    pandas 
    (either using pip install "the library name", or with conda)
 
 A reminder:
 - to install all necessary libraries inside the virtual environement you have created, e.g. gee as instructed in https://geemap.org/installation/.
